Hello my proposal for a website !
my website would be designed for NA League of Legends users to be able to see their
match history stats and compare them to League of legend's top 500 players match history

The user's that would come to my site would be NA based league of legends gamers 
the age range is accoding to riot anywhere from 13-25 years old 

I will be using riot's api which is a very detailed. I would use it to grab a user's ign 
and use that to use the same api and query for further details.
using that same api I can also grab top 500 player data and use that to compare 
against the user's data 

for the last part I am not sure yet I will be designing the actual app and all 
of its systems monday morning as part of the capstone's part one
