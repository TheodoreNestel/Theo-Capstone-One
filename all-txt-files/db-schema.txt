for this project I do not need a complicated database since I am not storing any data other than a user




all the data we play with is prone to massive changes since theyre based on a player's match history so the only data that I am planning 
on saving are as follow and will inside a singular table using Postgresql 


"user" table 

id - self incrementing 
email - for login 
password - for login 
player username - for back end api data calls 


there is no need for further data collection so consider this the schema
