here I will try to breakdown a few things I didnt understand verywell 



to start before you can do anything based around game objects 
you need to grab the user's account id by finding their account by name 

this will return an id which is considered the summonerid 
when making this call we used query params to submit our key 
https://na1.api.riotgames.com/lol/summoner/v4/summoners/by-name/Mistral?api_key=RGAPI-c232feec-92e4-4e08-92ec-2e7581424139
{
  "id": "AtQ82Kdou4yc7yrX4mlNMzgfUDv3ZsT2XpsKlEDTwb523oo",
  "accountId": "9lmMyyR_XEETSxoUtReHxx3ABMV3tJVe_1axc-1OTNWQb6E",
  "puuid": "iroxC-5ka4Z8wz7oyuB4T8CNDmfzO6aBrslYOi7aIuVY8egyQRxgC0Kwz00hOoLRMfkG_hqH47t8qQ",
  "name": "Mistral",
  "profileIconId": 4637,
  "revisionDate": 1617311417000,
  "summonerLevel": 325
}

encryptedsummonerid = id 
encryptedaccountid = account id 

etc 


this is important because it isnt specifed anywhere however all other inputs here are needed to make further more detailed cause
so make sure to store them 


when making a call to the matchmaking url it will return an object with a key or mathced and a value of an array with objects 

response.json().matches[0].matchId would be how to get into it 


also to use header params  

import requests

response = requests.get(
'https://api.github.com/search/repositories',
params={'q': 'requests+language:python'},
headers={'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3.text-match+json'},
)


theyre passed in like so 

to get the data I want the api is pretty comprehensive Ill write comments as I need to explaining what calls I made and why
