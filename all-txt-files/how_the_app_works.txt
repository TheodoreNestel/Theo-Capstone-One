I am calling this app league Vs 

this app will let players plug in their names to our site which will pull up their player information 
this will be their in game account information as well as the info about their last 10 games of legaue of legends 
the app will also let the user type in the username of another player to compare their profiles

-- REMOVED DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS --[Id like to also have a part in the middle that will grab the match data and directly have a box with the data comparison but that will be 
added later if i have time] --

the app will have authentication capabilities so if a user chooses to sign up they will not have to retype their username
the system will automatically pull up their game user profile and the data attached 


this app will rely on riot games api for which the notes will be under riot_api_notes 




necessary routes  

"/" home page which will have three links sign up - enter LoL username - log in 

"/player-page-public" this is where we will have the meat and potatoes of the app for unregistered users 
"/player-page" this will be the slightly more custom version for user's that are signed in 

"/signup" a simple signup form and then authentication after signup if all data is correct this will redirect to "/player-page"

"/login" a simple login page that will redirect to "player-page" if authentication works or flashes a didnt work message if it doesnt 
"/logout" an option that is only visible if the user is loged in and will return them to our homepage when clicked also log them out 


 

the logic of this app will rely heavily on the twitter clone project and the latest flask 2 assesment 5 RESTful api project 
both of those will also be up on my github should you want to take a look at the source material
