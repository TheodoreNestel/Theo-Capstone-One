Hello thank you for checking out my first capstone.
This will be my first web project that I did solo start to finish so if you find any kinks please let me know !

To start if you'd like some background as to how things work in theory check out all-txt-files 
this folder contains several txt files that go over the theoretical use and workings of the app.
There I will also have my db schema as well as notes as to how the RIOT api can be used 



If you want my app to work you will also need your own riot game api key. I was unable to get a permanent key.
Fortunately riot offers 24h working keys for free simply after making an account with them.

please go to : https://developer.riotgames.com 
and make an accoun the generate key 

in my app there will be a global variable on the back end called RIOT_API_KEY please change the value to your key 
and the app should work from there. 

You will need to do this every 24h which is when the key you just got will expire
